# Building Escape Game

## What is this
As part of my journey to learn about the Unreal Engine, this is a game where the main goal is quite simple (which is blatantly obvious in the the title as well): *escape the building*. Only we're *not* escaping a building but we're narrowing down to your own apartment. 
**This is a puzzle game**, where you'll have to find clues around your own apartment since you don't seem to find your own keys. Quite simple, right?

I'll be adding stuff to this repo and updating the README file along the way as more features are added.

Have fun! :+1:

## Theme and concept art

This small game was drafted during heavy studying sessions while listening to Lo-Fi music. As clich√© as it sounds, this served great inspiration for the environment and overall theme of the game, as it heavily relies on lightning and landscapes such the ones found below

### Cloning the repo

For the time being, while outlining the map, I have a wide range of assets at my disposal. However, these take up a bit too much of disk space and, given Git's strict file (and repo) size policies, it's impossible to push these assets directly. Therefore, after cloning this repo, to navigate through the project properly, you need to download the folder in this [link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/umjihmz8s2thev7/AACJpQ5lUh9Cv6NYqTLbmoyha?dl=0).

After the download is complete, place the folders you just downloaded **in** the Content folder of the cloned project.

> Please, note this is a **temporary** solution. I'm aware of Git LFS and I'll plan to use it *after* pruning the repo and discarding unnecessary assets within the project folders.
