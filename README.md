# Building Escape Game

## What is this
As part of my journey to learn about the Unreal Engine, this is a game where the main goal is quite simple (which is blatantly obvious in the the title as well): *escape the building*. Only we're *not* escaping a building but we're narrowing down to your own apartment. 
**This is a puzzle game**, where you'll have to find clues around your own apartment since you don't seem to find your own keys. Quite simple, right?

I'll be adding stuff to this repo and updating the README file along the way as more features are added.

Have fun! :+1:
